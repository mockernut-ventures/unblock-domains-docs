# Domains

## Introduction

The Domains page shows you which of your domains are being monitored along with their statuses. To&#x20;

To learn what each of the statuses represent, check out [#status-definitions](./#status-definitions "mention").

## Quick Start

## Status Definitions

* **Pending**
  This is the initial status each newly added domain gets before it has been scanned for the first time. The first scan may take up to 5 minutes to complete, and after that, your domain will be scanned on the schedule you define.

* **Healthy**
  This means your domain is not blacklisted or considered to be a suspicious domain, at least for now.

  Click [here](https://app.unblock.domains) and tap the toggle to enable Automatic Whitelisting to protect yourself against getting blacklisted in the future.

* **Blacklisted / "Get Unblocked"**
  This means your domain was identified as a suspicious domain and has ended up on at least one blacklist. We'll let you know which blacklists you've been found on via email whenever this happens.

  Click [here](https://app.unblock.domains) and tap the toggle to enable Automatic Whitelisting to protect yourself against getting blacklisted in the future.  
  
  You may have ended up in this situation by sending too many "spammy" emails or if you bought a domain that was already blacklisted before you bought it.
  
  Emails sent from your domain now have a high chance of ending up in the spam folder, and if you attempt to link your website on social media, the user that clicks your link may get a "malicious content" warning.
  
  Note: if you already have Automatic Whitelisting enabled, you can expect your domain to automatically transition to the "Whitelisting Requested" status shortly after getting blacklisted.

* **Whitelisting Requested**
  This means that we've automatically requested that your domain be removed from any blacklists it is currently on. 
  
  At the moment, we're just waiting for the owner of the blacklist to respond and remove you. We'll send you another email when this process is complete.
  
  Note that the final decision to remove your domain from the blacklist rests with the company controlling the blacklist, not with Unblock.Domains.
